## How to use
### Model Training/Testing
In order to train or test the model you have to run `python main.py -c configs/config_kfold.json` for a kfold cross validation setting and `python main.py -c configs/config.json` for a setting with a single dataset.
`configs/config(_kfold).json` contains every configuration option that you need to adjust in order to either train or test the model.

The results will be saved under a created folder named, 'experiments/name_of_the_setting/online(offline)/timestamp/'.

Please see the example file for further information and adjust it properly for your needs.

### GradCAM
Apply gradcam by running `python main.py -c configs/config_gradcam.json`. Again adjust the configuration file for your needs.

### Results Analysis
The `results_analysis.py` python file saves a json file with every eprformance metric you need, as well as the prediction results and the ground truth.
Run it by `python results_analysis.py -c configs/config_metrics.json`.

The analysis' results will be saved under a created folder named, experiments/name_of_the_setting/analysis/'.
